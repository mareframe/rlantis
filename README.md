# rlantis

rlantis is a set of helper functions for creating, manipulating, and viewing Atlantis files from R. 

At present, this package can generate initial conditions files and dummy hydro data. The development of this package is ongoing and will coincide with the development of the Icelandic Atlantis model. Feedback and/or request for additional functionality is welcomed.  

To install: 

```R
library(devtools)
install_github(repo = "cddesja/rlantis")
```
